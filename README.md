Used for youtube, will queue youtube videos and play them when the video ends. Has a UI to keep control of the playlist, enjoy!

The BONEY version is the bare bones of the project to minimize ram usage and maximize performance while keeping most of the functionality!

## Installation

Save the files in a folder and open them as an unpacked extension through the chrome extensions page.
