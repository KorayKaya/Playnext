Used for youtube, will queue youtube videos and play them when the video ends. Has a UI to keep control of the playlist, enjoy!

The BONEY version is the bare bones of the project to minimize ram usage and maximize performance while keeping most of the functionality!

## Installation

Save the files in a folder and open them as an unpacked extension through the chrome extensions page.

## Usage

Right click youtube videos you want to queue and click play next. Videos will affect the first loaded youtube page, right click anywhere on youtube and click play next here to select where the videos should play.
